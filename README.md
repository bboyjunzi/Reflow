**A toaster oven reflow controller sketch.

Control code for a ATmega328P running at 8MHz on the internal oscillator on a homemade PCB. Using an Adafruit MAX31855 thermocouple breakout board for temperature sensing and a Sparkfun LCD-09395 5V serial 16x2 LCD for display duties. 

Originally based on the RocketScream reflow code http://github.com/rocketscream/Reflow-Oven-Controller, with modifications made to deal with the different display, pinouts, and a leaded solder profile.
